Mobile Acuity CloudMVS demo for iOS
===================================

Mobile Acuity's cloud visual search solutions for mobile devices link printed material and physical objects with digital content, social media, commerce and marketing activity, while maintaining the integrity of brand message and eliminating the need for visible cues, such as QR codes.

This app allows you to test out our free API service and demonstrate it to your customers prior to writing any code yourself.

You can register and create your test cloud dataset via [our website](http://www.mobileacuity.com "Mobile Acuity Ltd") and use the resulting search API URL to configure the app. The dataset can be set to either follow any links in the results automatically to provide a seamless experience for demos, or to display the details of the result by default which is more useful during testing.

This app will soon also available for download from the App Store.

Cocoa Pods
----------
We have used [Cocoa Pods](http://cocoapods.org/ "Cocoa Pods") to manage some dependencies. Follow the instructions on that site to install and setup Cocoa Pods if you don't already use it.

Once you have checked out this project then in a shell change directory to the one containing thie README and run:

`$ pod install`

This will generate an Xcode workspace alongside the project we have provided and you should open that workspace rather than opening the project directly.
